                Did you know that when someone is “blind”, it 
                doesn't mean that they see only pitch black? 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="contenttext">
                Most people who are blind can see some light, or flashes of light, meaning that 
                if they walk into a room, they can tell if the lights are on or off. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="contenttext">
                Still though, some people do see pitch black, but this is very rare. 
                Being completely unable to see light is called “<strong class="tooltip">total blindness<span class="tooltiptext">When someone is completely unable to see light</span></strong>.”,
                also known as complete blindness.

            <p class="contenttext">
                Those who are completely blind are unable to see the difference between a bright room and a dark one.

                Using a blindfold, cover one person's eyes securely, so you can't see any light. 
                If you don't have a blindfold, a cloth will do!
                Make sure you know where you are, in a safe environment, before blindfolding yourself.

                Despite most cases of visual impairment not completely blocking out light, this activity 
                still uses total blindness.  This is because it makes the differences between living with 
                and without sight more obvious.
