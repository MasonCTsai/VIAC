                You.  Yes, you, the person reading this right now.  
                You can learn all about the different types of blindness, 
                what they do, and how, but none of it matters if you do nothing 
                with that knowledge.  That being said, what can you do?
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="contenttext">
                We as a community need to spread peace and kindness to others. 
                Making sure that everyone is respected no matter their disability 
                is very very important. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="contenttext">
                Let's start with the ways that you can help to start making a 
                difference with the discrimination blind people face.

            <p class="contenttext">
                You may be wondering what it means to use more inclusive words. 
                This means: don't be disrespectful to a person with blindness. 
                You shouldn't jump to conclusions and make assumptions about their 
                ability to get things done. 
            </p>

                For example, being quick to assume that a classmate who is blind cannot 
                join in a game or activity with others in the class. This is offensive 
                towards that classmate and can cause them to get hurt because they, just 
                like you, can do day-to-day activities. It is important that we encourage 
                those with blindness to live their lives normally, despite their disability. 
                We, as society should work together to provide support towards taking away 
                any obstacles that stop them from receiving full participation in our world.

                What do you think is the best way to get to know someone? Well, 
                luckily it is actually very simple! All you need to do is talk to them. 
                Find out the things they like and dislike, their favorite foods, become 
                friends! It is that simple. You will probably even find some things that 
                you guys have in common. Getting to know a person with blindness and 
                talking to them, is the best way to overcome opinions that are made up 
                and based on no actual reasons.

                You have the opportunity to share with others the knowledge that you 
                have learned through VIAC, and share that knowledge with others that 
                aren't as familiar with the troubles that blind people face, like your 
                friends, classmates, or family members. With this, you are spreading 
                awareness, making it more and more possible for a difference to be made 
                in not only our communities, but in our world.
