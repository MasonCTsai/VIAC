                are cloudy, gray films that develop on the inside of the eyeball, leading to a loss of vision.

                These can become worse and worse, where early stages do not cause total blindness.  Over time, 
                though, they can damage the eye enough to cause complete blindness.

                is when you have naturally low amounts of sugar in your blood, meaning your cells aren't able

                can be congenital (remember, that means it was developed at birth!), or be gotten later in life.  
                Visually, it is hard to see the effects of glaucoma, though it can sometimes cause redness in the eyes.
